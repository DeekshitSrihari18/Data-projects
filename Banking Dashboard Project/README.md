# Banking Dashboard - Power BI Project

## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard project provides a detailed and interactive visualization of key banking metrics including loans, deposits, accounts, and customer demographics. Built using **Power BI** and custom-designed with **Canva** for aesthetics, this multi-page dashboard gives users the ability to explore different aspects of banking operations efficiently.

The data powering this dashboard is sourced from a **MySQL database**. Data was connected and imported into Power BI using database connectors, and extensive data transformation and preparation were performed in **Power Query**, including cleaning, filtering, merging, and creating calculated columns to enable accurate and dynamic reporting across all pages of the dashboard.
