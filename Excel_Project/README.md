# Bike Sales Dashboard

## Overview
This Excel-based dashboard provides comprehensive visualization of bike sales data across different demographic and geographic segments. The dashboard enables quick insights into customer purchasing patterns based on income, age, commute distance, and various demographic filters.

## Dashboard Components

### Filters
The dashboard includes several filter panels allowing for dynamic data exploration:
- **Marital Status**: Filter by Married or Single
- **Region**: Filter by Europe, North America, or Pacific
- **Education**: Filter by education level (Bachelors, Graduate Degree, High School, Partial College, Partial High School)

### Visualizations

#### Average Income per Purchase
- Bar chart comparing average income between customers who purchased bikes versus those who didn't
- Data segmented by gender (Male/Female)
- Shows that non-purchasers generally have higher average incomes than purchasers in both gender categories

#### Customer Age Bracket
- Line chart showing the distribution of customers across age brackets (Adolescent, Middle Age, Old Age)
- Segmented by bike purchase status (Yes/No)
- Middle-aged customers form the largest segment of bike purchasers

#### Customer Commute
- Line chart illustrating the relationship between commute distance and bike purchasing behavior
- X-axis shows commute distance ranges (0-1 Miles, 1-2 Miles, 2-5 Miles, 5-10 Miles, More than 10 miles)
- Short-distance commuters (0-1 miles) show the highest purchase rates
- Purchase likelihood generally decreases as commute distance increases

## Key Insights
From the dashboard, several patterns can be observed:
1. Income is not a direct predictor of bike purchases - non-purchasers actually show higher average incomes
2. Middle-aged customers represent the primary market for bike sales
3. Customers with shorter commutes (especially 0-1 miles) are more likely to purchase bikes
4. Purchase patterns can be further analyzed by filtering through demographic variables

## Usage Instructions
- Use the filter panels on the left to segment data by specific demographic groups
- All charts will update dynamically based on selected filters
- Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously for more granular analysis
