# 🧹 Data Cleaning with SQL

This project demonstrates a comprehensive **data cleaning** process using **SQL**, focusing on transforming raw data into a clean, analysis-ready format. The SQL script includes steps commonly used in real-world data engineering and analytics pipelines.

## 📂 Project Overview

**Filename:** `Data_Cleaning.sql`  
**Type:** SQL Project  
**Purpose:** To clean and preprocess raw data for downstream analysis or reporting.

## 🛠️ Key Cleaning Tasks Performed

- Removed duplicates and null values
- Standardized text formatting (e.g., capitalization, trimming spaces)
- Replaced placeholder values (e.g., 'N/A', 'unknown') with `NULL`
- Fixed inconsistent data types
- Extracted or reformatted date fields
- Verified data integrity with constraints and checks

## 🧑‍💻 Technologies Used

- **SQL** (Standard SQL syntax)
- Executed on any RDBMS platform (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, etc.)

## 📊 Use Case

This script can be used as a template for cleaning customer data, product inventories, transaction logs, or any structured tabular dataset that requires:

- Accurate and consistent formatting
- Removal of redundant or invalid entries
- Improved reliability for analytics and reporting

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `Data_Cleaning.sql` in your SQL IDE or query editor
3. Run the script against your sample/raw data table
4. Modify table and column names as needed for your specific dataset

## 📌 Notes

- Make sure to back up your original data before running cleaning operations.
- This script is modular – feel free to comment/uncomment parts based on your needs.
