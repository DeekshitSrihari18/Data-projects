# Tableau Project 
### 🏛️ Housing Price Analysis Dashboard (Tableau)

#### 📄 Project Overview
This project presents a data visualization dashboard built using **Tableau**, focused on analyzing housing prices based on various factors such as number of bedrooms, zip code, and weekly trends. The dashboard provides actionable insights into average rental prices across regions and time.

#### 📈 Dashboard Highlights
- **Price per Bedrooms**: Shows average calendar price segmented by the number of bedrooms
- **Count per Bedrooms**: Displays how many listings fall under each bedroom category
- **Price per Zipcode (Map)**: Geographical representation of average prices by zip code
- **Price by Zipcode (Bar Chart)**: Compares average prices across different zip codes
- **Price per Week**: Time series graph showing how average prices changed over time in 2016

#### 🚀 Tools Used
- **Tableau Public/Desktop**
- **Mapbox for Geo Mapping**
- **Data Source**: Seattle Airbnb or housing dataset *(please add source if publicly available)*

#### 📊 Key Insights
- Higher bedroom count correlates with significantly higher average prices
- Zip codes like **98109** and **98103** show higher average calendar prices
- Peak weekly prices occurred during mid-year 2016
